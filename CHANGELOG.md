## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `ZipGPBF`'s boolean-parameter constructor silently dropping every flag after the first `true` condition, due to an unparenthesized `if`/`else` chain inside an `or` expression (each `else` branch greedily absorbed the rest of the chain). In particular, the common case of only the two `true`-by-default parameters (`omitChecksumAndSizes`, `languageEncoding`) — e.g. a bare `ZipGPBF()` — produced a value with `LANGUAGE_ENCODING` missing entirely.
- `ZipArchiver.appendEntry` always forcing `ZipGPBF.OMIT_CHECKSUM_AND_SIZES` (deferred checksum/sizes, terminated by a trailing data descriptor) regardless of the entry's own `gpbf`, while `ZipUnarchiver.extractStoredData` explicitly refuses to read `STORED` entries written that way (`"ZIP stored entries with data descriptors are not supported"`). In practice this made any archive with `ZipCompressionMethod.NONE` entries — written by this same library — unreadable by this same library's own `Unarchiver`, even though third-party readers (which fall back to the central directory) could still open it. `STORED` entries are now buffered in memory one at a time and written with real checksum/sizes directly in the local file header (no descriptor); `DEFLATE` entries are unaffected, since `Inflater.computeCompressedSize` already lets the unarchiver determine their length without one.
